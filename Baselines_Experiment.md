# Baseline Experiments
## Data
* Currently doing experiments on GeogiaTech dataset
### Training Set
* The whole dataset is too large for training
    * Not neccessary - too many small propagations
* Sampling

## Model
### Main Model
* Based on [Rumor Detection on Twitter with Tree-structured Recursive Neural Networks](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P18-1184/) (ACL'18)
* Top-down and bottom-up tree-structured recursive neural network
    * GRU as node operator
### Classifier
