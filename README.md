# Witbier VI - Hate Evolution

Study the factors affecting the evolution of hate speech. 

Some of the potential question to ask:

1. What kind of topic is likely to spark hate speech? 
2. Does the influence of the user or virality of the tweet affect the spread of hate speech? 
3. Does culture play a role?
4. Does the population's sentiment or mood play a role?
